/**
 * A Vert.x event-bus is a light-weight distributed messaging system which allows different parts of your application,
 * or different applications and services to communicate with each in a loosely coupled way.
 * <p>
 * An event-bus supports publish-subscribe messaging, point-to-point messaging and request-response messaging.
 * <p>
 * Message delivery is best-effort and messages can be lost if failure of all or part of the event bus occurs.
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the documentation for more information on the event bus.
