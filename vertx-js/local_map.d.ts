/**
 * Local maps can be used to share data safely in a single Vert.x instance.
 * <p>
 * The map only allows immutable keys and values in the map, OR certain mutable objects such as Buffer
 * instances which will be copied when they are added to the map.
 * <p>
 * This ensures there is no shared access to mutable state from different threads (e.g. different event loops) in the
 * Vert.x instance, and means you don't have to protect access to that state using synchronization or locks.
