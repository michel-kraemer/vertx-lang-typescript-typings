/**
 * Contains a broad set of operations for manipulating files on the file system.
 * <p>
 * A (potential) blocking and non blocking version of each operation is provided.
 * <p>
 * The non blocking versions take a handler which is called when the operation completes or an error occurs.
 * <p>
 * The blocking versions are named <code>xxxBlocking</code> and return the results, or throw exceptions directly.
 * In many cases, depending on the operating system and file system some of the potentially blocking operations
 * can return quickly, which is why we provide them, but it's highly recommended that you test how long they take to
 * return in your particular application before using them on an event loop.
 * <p>
 * Please consult the documentation for more information on file system support.
