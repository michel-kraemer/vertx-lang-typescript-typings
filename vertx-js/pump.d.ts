/**
 * Pumps data from a ReadStream to a WriteStream and performs flow control where necessary to
 * prevent the write stream buffer from getting overfull.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class read items from a ReadStream and write them to a WriteStream. If data
 * can be read faster than it can be written this could result in the write queue of the WriteStream growing
 * without bound, eventually causing it to exhaust all available RAM.
 * <p>
 * To prevent this, after each write, instances of this class check whether the write queue of the WriteStream is full, and if so, the ReadStream is paused, and a <code>drainHandler</code> is set on the
 * WriteStream.
 * <p>
 * When the WriteStream has processed half of its backlog, the <code>drainHandler</code> will be
 * called, which results in the pump resuming the ReadStream.
 * <p>
 * This class can be used to pump from any ReadStream to any WriteStream,
 * e.g. from an HttpServerRequest to an AsyncFile,
 * or from NetSocket to a WebSocket.
 * <p>
 * Please see the documentation for more information.
