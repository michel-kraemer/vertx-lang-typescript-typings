/**
 * A helper class which allows you to easily parse protocols which are delimited by a sequence of bytes, or fixed
 * size records.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class take as input Buffer instances containing raw bytes,
 * and output records.
 * <p>
 * For example, if I had a simple ASCII text protocol delimited by '\n' and the input was the following:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * buffer1:HELLO\nHOW ARE Y
 * buffer2:OU?\nI AM
 * buffer3: DOING OK
 * buffer4:\n
 * </pre>
 * Then the output would be:<p>
 * <pre>
 * buffer1:HELLO
 * buffer2:HOW ARE YOU?
 * buffer3:I AM DOING OK
 * </pre>
 * Instances of this class can be changed between delimited mode and fixed size record mode on the fly as
 * individual records are read, this allows you to parse protocols where, for example, the first 5 records might
 * all be fixed size (of potentially different sizes), followed by some delimited records, followed by more fixed
 * size records.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class can't currently be used for protocols where the text is encoded with something other than
 * a 1-1 byte-char mapping.
 * <p>
 * Please see the documentation for more information.
