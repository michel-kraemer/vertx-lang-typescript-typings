/**
 * Represents a server-side HTTP response.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this is created and associated to every instance of
 * HttpServerRequest that.
 * <p>
 * It allows the developer to control the HTTP response that is sent back to the
 * client for a particular HTTP request.
 * <p>
 * It contains methods that allow HTTP headers and trailers to be set, and for a body to be written out to the response.
 * <p>
 * It also allows files to be streamed by the kernel directly from disk to the
 * outgoing HTTP connection, bypassing user space altogether (where supported by
 * the underlying operating system). This is a very efficient way of
 * serving files from the server since buffers do not have to be read one by one
 * from the file and written to the outgoing socket.
 * <p>
 * It implements WriteStream so it can be used with
 * Pump to pump data with flow control.
